Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) is an acronym that is largely used to refer the most necessary rules for implementing permanent storage in server-side applications. Its standardized, industry-wide use directs developers on the most important functions of their server-side applications, allowing them to not just have a generally well understood format for data but a strong foundation for designing and implementing database storage that can be searched quickly, efficiently, and without error. Additionally, using CRUD allows for developers to institute a system that allows for consistent, accurate modification of data whether it is removing, updating, moving, or adding records and attributes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using CRUD, a developer can create simple and / or complex databases that can be used within applications to retrieve and display data stored on a remote server. This method of developing also allows the implementation of secure encoding of data, administrator rights, security against SQL injections that target the data for modification or retrieval from an outside, 3rd-party source. In essence, CRUD is a powerful developmental tool that allows for the development of server-side databases that are secure but allow for easy retrieval of information for user's through applications.
